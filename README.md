# Mouse-Hover-Smurf-Cat
The project is a web page with an interactive mouse hover effect. It consists of a central image displayed on the page, and when the user hovers the cursor over a designated rectangular area within that image, a series of zoomed-in images are displayed successively. The zoomed-in images change as the cursor moves over different rectangles.
